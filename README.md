  <h1>Recipe Generator</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The Recipe Generator is a web application that allows users to input the name of a dish and receive its recipe. In addition to dish-name searches, users can also find recipes based on ingredients they already have at home or by uploading an image of a dish. The app combines a user-friendly frontend with a powerful backend to deliver AI-generated recipe suggestions tailored to each search method.</p>
